Security Audits are meant to capture as much information as they can to verify if something should have been that way,
so when you go back and check you can change it if need be.

SOC 2 is a framework

They were originally introduced to address the growing need of companies to externally validate
and communicate their state of security

The trust principles are selected by a company based on what is most important to your customers

they are
security
confidentiality
avalability
integrity
privacy


Hereâ€™s an easy way to remember: S = SCOPE, T = TIME.

i.e.

SOC 1 = Financial Scope.

SOC 2 = Information Security Scope.

Type I = At a single point in time.

Type II = Over the past 6 months.


As a vendor it is almost required you get SOC 2 compliance.

These are the general policies related to a SOC 2 exam that you must comply with:

Information Security Policy
Access Control Policy
Password Policy
Change Management Policy
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Policy
Incident Response Policy
Logging and Monitoring Policy
Vendor Management Policy
Data Classification Policy
